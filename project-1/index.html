            <h2 class="title1">Golden Sword</h2>
            <p class="bodytext1">The Golden Sword of Battle (also known as Scarlet) is Finn's weapon of choice throughout most of seasons one and two.
            The blade is dented, chipped, and dirty. Its hilt is black with some worn leather grip-straps and a red gemstone in the
            pommel. In "Business Time", the Business Men polish and sharpen the sword, making this episode the only one in which the
            golden sword appears to be in excellent condition.
            In "The Real You," the golden sword passes through the Bubble creator and becomes four-dimensional. When Finn uses the
            4-D golden sword to attack the black hole he created, Finn's golden sword is sent into the Cotton Candy Forest by the
            explosion. Finn is without a sword until "Mystery Train", which could mean he lost it after the explosion.</p>

            <h2 class="title2">Root Sword</h2>
            <p class="bodytext2">In "Mystery Train," Finn obtained the Root Sword (the name is non-canonical), which became his primary weapon. He finds
            the sword on the caboose of the train and uses it to attack The conductor. He next uses it against the Monster in the
            beginning of "Belly of the Beast". It is seen briefly in "Mortal Recoil," when Finn throws it at Ice King, "Conquest of
            Cuteness," and in "Jake vs. Me-Mow." After breaking the Finn Sword, he can be seen using it in "Normal Man" and
            "Elemental". It can be seen again in the Issue 1 (although the comics are non-canonical).
            Finn keeps it in a makeshift pocket on the side of his backpack. The sword gets its name from its root like handle, that
            seems to be comprised of 2 main "roots" spiraled around one another. The actual blade is a slightly pinkish tone of
            silver, double sided, and in good condition with the exception of a small chip on one of the blade's sides.</p>

            <h2 class="title1">Demon blood Sword</h2>
            <p class="bodytext1">The Demon Blood Sword (or simply demon sword) first appears in the episode "Dad's Dungeon," replacing the root sword as
            his main weapon from thereon. In the episode, Finn and Jake go to Joshua's dungeon to retrieve their family sword. At
            the end of the dungeon Finn finds it encased in locks and stone. He breaks it loose and uses it to fight the final
            monster of the dungeon. The sword is infused with demon blood, which causes Kee-Oth to sporadically appear and plead to
            Joshua (and later, Jake, thinking he's Joshua) for the return of his blood. The sword seems to be in great condition.
            Kee-Oth is easily banished away using the spell "Kee Oth Rama Pancake." This message is written behind the handle's
            wrapper. In "Return to the Nightosphere," Finn spins it in front of the blood mist cloud, and hits Marceline with it,
            thinking she is Hunson Abadeer. The sword also shows immunity to Marceline's blood mist cloud blasts. In "Daddy's Little
            Monster," Finn can be seen holding it throughout the video files on Jake's phone. In "Beyond this Earthly Realm," Finn
            uses it to slash one of the heads from The Dead One. In "Gotcha!" he uses it to save Lumpy Space Princess from the
            Mirror Finns. It also appeared in "All the Little People" and "Puhoy." In "Vault of Bones" it is shown to be
            fire-immune. Finn reluctantly broke it in the episode "Play Date" and released the blood inside. In "The Pit" Finn has a
            duplicate of the demon blood sword made from frozen grape juice, blessed by Shelby. It is used to trick Kee-Oth into
            killing himself.</p>

        <h2 class="title2">Grass Sword</h2>
        <p class="bodytext2">The Grass Sword first appears in the episode "Blade of Grass," where it comes to replace the broken demon sword. Finn
        buys the grass sword for three dollars from the Grassy Wizard. Finn discovers that the sword is cursed when it begins
        following him around and tries to bind to his body. When he accepts the sword's curse, he gains greater control over its
        abilities. Finn wore it around his arm and could extend it into a sword at his will. It ultimately ripped off Finn's
        right arm when it tried to save him from the Citadel in pursuit of his father Martin and some of the multiverse's worst
        criminals. When Finn's arm grew back in "Breezy," his new arm was actually one made of grass hidden under his skin. His
        grass arm has the ability to burst through his skin and control itself like the grass sword. The Grass Sword can no
        longer be used as it took control over and manipulated the Finn Sword to make the character Fern. A reaction to when
        Finn tried to regain control over it so it would not kill a beloved character.</p>

        <h2 class="title1">Finn Sword</h2>
        <p class="bodytext1">The Finn Sword is a sword that Finn obtains in "Is That You?" It replaces the grass sword. The sword is created when
        Finn prevents himself from waking up Jake to save Prismo. However, it is first seen in "Breezy" when Finn imagines
        Princess Bubblegum holding it. This sword appears to have the spirit of the version of himself that he stopped in "Is
        That You?" inside, and while Finn uses this sword, his physical attributes (strength, agility, etc.) are doubled. In
        "Dentist," it is seen cutting through giant worms with ease, suggesting it is quite sharp and durable. The Finn Sword
        can no longer be used as it combined with the Grass Sword to make Fern. After Fern's destruction in Come Along With Me,
        his remains take the form of a seed shaped like the Finn Sword. That night, Finn and Jake plant the seedling together,
        which causes a massive new tree to sprout with a remade Finn Sword lodged in the top. Many years later into the distant
        future, Shermy and Beth find the sword on the top of the tree.</p>
