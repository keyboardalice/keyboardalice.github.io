            <h2 class="title1">Golden Sword</h2>
            <p class="bodytext1">The Golden Sword of Battle (also known as Scarlet) is Finn's weapon of choice throughout most of seasons one and two.
            The blade is dented, chipped, and dirty. Its hilt is black with some worn leather grip-straps and a red gemstone in the
            pommel. In "Business Time", the Business Men polish and sharpen the sword, making this episode the only one in which the
            golden sword appears to be in excellent condition.
            In "The Real You," the golden sword passes through the Bubble creator and becomes four-dimensional. When Finn uses the
            4-D golden sword to attack the black hole he created, Finn's golden sword is sent into the Cotton Candy Forest by the
            explosion. Finn is without a sword until "Mystery Train", which could mean he lost it after the explosion.</p>

            <h2 class="title2">Root Sword</h2>
            <p class="bodytext2">In "Mystery Train," Finn obtained the Root Sword (the name is non-canonical), which became his primary weapon. He finds
            the sword on the caboose of the train and uses it to attack The conductor. He next uses it against the Monster in the
            beginning of "Belly of the Beast". It is seen briefly in "Mortal Recoil," when Finn throws it at Ice King, "Conquest of
            Cuteness," and in "Jake vs. Me-Mow." After breaking the Finn Sword, he can be seen using it in "Normal Man" and
            "Elemental". It can be seen again in the Issue 1 (although the comics are non-canonical).
            Finn keeps it in a makeshift pocket on the side of his backpack. The sword gets its name from its root like handle, that
            seems to be comprised of 2 main "roots" spiraled around one another. The actual blade is a slightly pinkish tone of
            silver, double sided, and in good condition with the exception of a small chip on one of the blade's sides.</p>
